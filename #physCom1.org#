* Week_01

** Module overview

 - idea, prototype, iterate


 - Electricity
   - voltage - preassure
   - current - amount of energy pushed thru a circuit
   - resistance - ohms- how much energy has been squeezed out of the circuit

     - Power - Watts:
       - Voltage x current
       - Power(P) = Current(I) * Voltage(V)
       - 


  - Breadboarding
    1. simple circuit from powered-board(fakeduino)
    2. Soldered up an LED with a 220ohm resistor attached to tthe positive leg.

** HOMEWORK
• Please make the most interesting button you can.
• You can ONLY USE BUTTONS as your input but you can USE LEDs or the Serial Monitor as your output.
• Think about the meaning of what you make, how it will be used, the colours you choose, the design of your device.
• Can you make it tell a story? Can you make it surprise the user?
• Deliverables:
• Upload this assignment to the VLE and include: A short video of the project (1 minute or less) , your code, a
schematic of your circuit. (This can be hand drawn or done on a computer)
• Post just the video of your device to the class forum so we can all see everyone's work.
• Please think of this brief as an opportunity to try things out, the result does not have to be perfect, feel free to
try things and fail, to play, to experiment, to get things wrong.
  

* Week_03

 - recap
   - code
     - statments
     - functions
     - variables
     - conditionals
   - schematics


 - repetition
   - forloops
     for(int i; i < 100; i++){
     println(i); // prints 0 - 99
     }
   - incriment
     1. i = i + 1;
     2. i++;
     3. i += 1;
     4. i + otherValue


 - analog vs digital
   - digital is either on or off
   - less susceptable to inteference


 - analoG
   - can be any value and move smoothly among values
   - prone to inteference


 - PWM -pulse width modulation
   - emulatiung an analog signal
   - use it to dim an led
   -

     - The Arduino Mega has 15 PWM Pins on :
   - 2 - 13, 44 - 46

 - analogWrite


- LDR Light dependent resistor
  - must use a 10k resitor


- RGB LED
  - 3 leds in 1
  - 3 resistors


- Servo Motors
  - 3 WIRES
  - yellow - data
  - red
  - black


** HOMEWORK

*** EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED

You should make a physical installation that subverts my expectations.
The goal of this mini-project is to build a physical installation (for example this could be an art work, game, some thing
useful, a product, an interactive installation etc) that has at least one input and one output and does something
unexpected. Think about what the user/viewer will: SEE, HEAR, FEEL. Think about how to prototype your installation
and test it, how will people know what to do, what feedback will they get, will there be interaction. Think about what
you would expect your installation to do and then make it do the opposite.
Please include, at the minimum, the following: - one input (sensor) - one output (actuator)
Upload this assignment to the VLE and include: A short video of the project (1 minute or less) , your code, a schematic
of your circuit. The schematic can be hand drawn or created using other software you choose - for example Fritzing
or EasyEDA. ALSO Post the short video of your device to the class forum so we can all see everyone's work. Please
upload everything to the VLE and forum.
Please think of this brief as an opportunity to try things out, the result does not have to be perfect, feel free to try
things and fail, to play, to experiment, to get things wrong.



*** What do I want to make?
 - A box that makes noise on the inside but when you open the box everything stops.

 - How am i going to ame this?
   - A box that has servo meters in it
   - The servos run in the dark with being set from a LDR.
   - when the LDR senses light then the servos stop
   - something is attached to the servos

* Week_04

- projects & documentation 

- Ultrasonic distance sensor
  - cheap

  - millis()z

    - use millis() instead of delay

  - blinkwithoutdelay arduino sketch is the non delay code to look at


  -calibration --- MillisModuloDemo

   - smoothing
     - Arrays


 - DC motors
   - spin forever
   - little torque

 - one of two positions
 - on or off
 - used with either a relay or a MOSFET
 -


 
- define a minimum vable project
- big idea 
  - then scale back


* Project Proposal

- Deadline Oct 31st


- submit a proposal
- You should submit a proposal in PDF format for the project you'd like to make between now and the end of term.
- 
- Describe the project using words, drawings and diagrams.
- Tell is what you plan to make for your MVP, and how you will build the project from there.
- Talk about the user journey, <b> how the user will know what to do with your piece.<b>
  - Talk about what your piece will convey to the user.


- Deadline October 31st.
- You should try and answer the following questions:
  - What's your project about? is it a game, installation, instrument, performancd or someting else?


-  What is my project about?
 It's a self created analog feedback loop
    
  - What does this project do? What is it for?

    my project is a sound installation


  - Who is it for? What so you hope the experience will be for the participant? What do you hope they think/feel?

    it is for people to experience ?

    I hope they feel something?
    
  - How do you imagine it set up and where?

    inside a darkish quiet space
    
  - How does thos project work? What is the setup?

    the project is a an array of small speakers attached to stepper motors which raise up 
    
  - What is the input to your system? What is the output of your system?
    the input to my system is possibly either a distance sensor or a temperature sensor along with the motor sound being picked up by a piezo mic. The output is  of the  amplified pmotor moving up and down.
    
  - What technologies are you using? what hardware? what software?

   technologies are arduino and the stepper library, the distance library and analog amplifiers.
   
    
  - A diagram, picture, sketch photograph of the project.

 - A video mockup or story board of the interaction.

     - Any problems you envisage? What challenges might you face? How might you solve them?

       the main problem would be for the cost of this. more arduinos, stepper motors, amplifiers and speakers.
       another problem could be making multiple distance sensors work together or even making multiple arduidos run from the one sensor input.

      

        - What methods you might use for testing the project?
	  already with testing the stepper motor I'm finding that the 28BYJ-48 doesnt have much torque. At least at the speed I'm running it at.
	  
	  
  - What might you need to buy or borrow?
    stepper motors, arduinos, amplifiers and speakers
  - What new skill will you need to aquire?
    making horn enclosures for the speakers.
    
  - Specific help: anything specifix you'd like feedback of help with??
    I'm not so sure atm??


- You should submit a proposal in PDF format for the project you;d like to  make
  between now and the end of term.
- Describe the Project using words, diagrams and drawings.
- Tell us what you plan to make for your MVP, and how you will build the project from there.

*** BOM
- things I need to look into?
  - Stepper Motors
    -[[https://lastminuteengineers.com/28byj48-stepper-motor-arduino-tutorial/][StepperMotors]]
- CD4049
- LM386
  - speakers
  
    
problems with torque with usint the acellstepper library.
the stepper library was fine with this.

maybe some gearing?

keep looking into the accelstepper manual.

- maybe the installation is static until  aperson comes into the room, triggering the machine into action? as if replicating the workers idleness when not under the scrutiny of the managers watch. even machines want to rest. They also understand the futility of manual work [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Kp5qrCExps][robot suicide]] 

- carry on looking at the work book
