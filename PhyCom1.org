* Week_01

** Module overview

 - idea, prototype, iterate


 - Electricity
   - voltage - preassure
   - current - amount of energy pushed thru a circuit
   - resistance - ohms- how much energy has been squeezed out of the circuit

     - Power - Watts:
       - Voltage x current
       - Power(P) = Current(I) * Voltage(V)
       - 


  - Breadboarding
    1. simple circuit from powered-board(fakeduino)
    2. Soldered up an LED with a 220ohm resistor attached to tthe positive leg.

* Week_02

** multimeter
- testing continuity
- ohms
- v~ = AC power
- v w 2 lines = DC current
  - checked with a 9V battery
- Used desktop psu to check current
- code
  - variables
  - functions
  - conditionals
- Blinking light sketch
  -changed blonking light sketch
- added a 2nd led and changed the timings


- Debugging

* HOMEWORK
 • Please make the most interesting button you can.
• You can ONLY USE BUTTONS as your input but you can USE LEDs or the Serial Monitor as your output.
• Think about the meaning of what you make, how it will be used, the colours you choose, the design of your device.
• Can you make it tell a story? Can you make it surprise the user?
• Deliverables:
• Upload this assignment to the VLE and include: A short video of the project (1 minute or less) , your code, a
schematic of your circuit. (This can be hand drawn or done on a computer)
• Post just the video of your device to the class forum so we can all see everyone's work.
• Please think of this brief as an opportunity to try things out, the result does not have to be perfect, feel free to
try things and fail, to play, to experiment, to get things wrong.
