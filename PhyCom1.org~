* Week_01

** Module overview

 - idea, prototype, iterate


 - Electricity
    - voltage - preassure
    - current - amount of energy pushed thru a circuit
    - resistance - ohms- how much energy has been squeezed out of the circuit

      - Power - Watts:
	- Voltage x current
	- Power(P) = Current(I) * Voltage(V)


  - Breadboarding
    1. simple circuit from powered-board(fakeduino)
    2. Soldered up an LED with a 220ohm resistor attached to tthe positive leg.
